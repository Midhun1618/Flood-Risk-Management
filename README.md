**Flood Risk Assessment for Agricultural Areas**

This project aims to assess the flood risk in agricultural areas using satellite imagery. By analyzing satellite data, the goal is to predict areas at high risk of flooding, helping to mitigate potential damage to crops and ensuring timely interventions. The system utilizes machine learning models to process the data and provide actionable insights for flood management.

 **Features**

- Satellite Imagery Processing: Analyzes satellite imagery to identify flood-prone zones in agricultural fields.
- Machine Learning Integration: Uses machine learning models to predict flood risk based on historical and environmental data.
- Risk Visualization: Generates heatmaps and flood risk zone maps to visualize areas with higher flood probabilities.
- Data Analysis: Combines historical flood data, weather patterns, and geographical features for accurate risk assessment.

 **Technologies Used**

- Python: The primary programming language for implementing the project.
- TensorFlow: Used for training and deploying machine learning models to predict flood risks.
- OpenCV: For image processing and feature extraction from satellite imagery.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing results, including heatmaps and flood-prone areas.
- Pandas & Numpy: Used for data manipulation, analysis, and handling large datasets.
- Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
